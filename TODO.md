# TODO

- I want to add extra documents and all the CVs and cover letters I wrote
- Make the output less generic and more human like. Try different models?
- Add copy button to the text and copy as text without any formatting
- Add extra features like write my self introduction, update CV summary, update CV job description
- LLM is very slow on Hang's laptop. How to make it work on the laptop as well? EC2?
